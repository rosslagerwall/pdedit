pdedit
======

What is it?
-----------

pdedit is a set of Bash scripts to edit pdf files.

A common use case is to insert text or images into otherwise uneditable pdf
files.
To do this, it converts the pdf into a set of svg files and allows the user to
edit each page in Inkscape before performing the reverse operation and
converting back into a pdf.

Requirements
------------

Bash - http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/
pdftk - http://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/
pdf2svg - http://www.cityinthesky.co.uk/pdf2svg.html
Inkscape - http://inkscape.org/

pdedit has been tested on Fedora Linux 17 with:
- Bash 4.2.37
- pdftk 1.44
- pdf2svg 0.2.1
- Inkscape 0.48.2 r9819 (Apr 11 2012)

Installation
------------

Copy the pdedit-* scripts to the location of your choice.
For example:
>>> cp pdedit-* ~/bin

Running
-------

Assuming the scripts are installed somewhere on your path and test.pdf is the
pdf we want to edit:

Break up the pdf into pages; for example, pg0001.pdf, pg0002.pdf
>>> pdedit-break test.pdf

Edit a page; for example, page 2.
This converts the pdf to an svg and opens Inkscape.
Once you have applied your edits, saved, and closed, pdedit will convert the
svg back into a pdf.
>>> pdedit-edit 2

The previous step can be run any number of times for each page that needs to be
edited.

Join the pages into a single pdf again:
>>> pdedit-join output.pdf

Clean up the intermediate page files:
>>> pdedit-clean
